Optimize the naive implementation as much as possible so as to weed out any doubt that its slowness could come from other places than the extra rounds taken.

Fix md5.c to avoid all the mallocs and use real types instead.

Consider implementing exhaustive searches (possibly with different strategies) instead of passing the length to the attack function.
